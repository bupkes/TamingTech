If you can't see the screen well, then it can be hard to use the keyboard - and of course this will make it hard to enter text when you're trying to do something like writing an email or doing a Google search.

Although there are a few ways to get around this (for example you could get an Bluetooth keyboard and touch-type), one of the easiest ways is to use the in-built _dictation_ function.

## Starting dictation

If you are able to, then a quick way to start your device listening to you is to tap the _Dictate_ button. This is a little microphone symbol, which you'll find just to the left of the Spacebar.
